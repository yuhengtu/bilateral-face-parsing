- Convolutionalize the loss function of Jon Barronâ€™s Fast Bilateral Solver (ECCV 2016 Runner-up) and optimize
depth image with it
- Applying Bilateral Solver as an auxiliary loss function to Face Parsing task to achieve matting

Prepare training data:
- download [CelebAMask-HQ dataset](https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ)
- change file path in the `prepropess_data.py`  and run
